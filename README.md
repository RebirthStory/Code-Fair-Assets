# CDU Code Fair Assets

This repositry acts as a starting point for students creating a website for the CDU Code Fair as part of HIT226 Assignment 2

## Bonus: Geting Started

You can `fork` this repositry (top right of the screen) as a starting point for your assignment. This will allow you to `pull` future assests into your project when they are added to the repository (just don't rename or move any files)
